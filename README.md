All data used in this study consist of bacterial mutation-frequency measurements derived from laboratory strains (Escherichia coli WT, priA, and recG). All code and processed data are publicly available at: https://github.com/shkim9391/OU-Branching-Bacteria. The full computational workflow—including PyMC scripts, preprocessing routines, and visualization notebooks—is reproducible from the repository. No proprietary datasets or restrictions apply.
